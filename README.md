## Introduction
Hello and welcome to the Read me documentation for my PP1 Project, named: Winpea World. This website is the foundation for an E-Commerce website which I intend to 
build upon in the future projects of mine. The theme of the site itself is a Jewellery & Fashion brand; one that hopes to bring audiences from all across the globe, 
with British and Japanese cultures being the main driving point for the design of each product. The design of the site is colorful yet not too overpowering, so as to give a vibrant feel with a calmness to the tones of each page as the user progresses through the site.

### User manual 
The website itself has been designed in such a way that it works in different ways depending on which device(s) the user is on. For example: on Windows or iMac devices, the Gallery page will have a hover & zoom effect for the images that user chooses to look at. Whereas on mobile and tablets devices, the images need to be clicked on in order for the user to be able to focus on a specific image within the set. Design choices such as this one have been done in order to keep the viewing experience fluid but also so as to not overpower and disorientate the user.

## Design

### Design Choices
- The design choice for the website was to be based around the colour & shine that a diamond provides, this is actually
the navbar & footer background itself but it has been repeated in order to fill the width of the webpage.

- I wanted to use this diamond shine effect across many elements on the website, so I included it within the imagery on the home
page to represent a ring shape around the team members that I've put there.
<br>

![Diamond design](docs/features/diamond-effect.jpg)

### Colour
The colour scheme for the website was to follow the brand logo's simple black and white; and thus I have kept all the writing and font elements
contrast so the readability is high. These simple colours mesh very well with the diamond design I've chosen and allow the imagery to pop out.

### Fonts
Pacifico used for the headings & nav bar elements with Sans Serif & cursive as a fallback.
<br>
Libre Baskerville used as the main body font and Serif used as a fallback.

### Structure
Each webpage on the site is created so that the user can be easily familiarised with what content they are looking at. There is a navigation bar, with the brand logo aligned to the left side and the page links on the right. The structure allows user to easily pick out what content they are searching for, the pages are as follows:

- A landing page with sections consisting of carousel images, welcome section & meet the staff section.
- A catalogue page with a list of products the company makes.
- A gallery page with a panel of various images encompassing many aspects of the brand.
- A contact us page with a contact form, an image to visualise the store location, a map and contact details.
